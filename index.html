            <!-- <h2 id="instructions-content-subtitle">Basics</h2> -->
            <p>
                Basics:<br>
                There are two teams of two, making four players in total. During the game, partners will be placed
                opposite of each other so two people of the same team never play consecutively.
                <br>
                During each game, there is one team that is trying to “protect” points and one trying to “catch”
                points. For instructional purposes, the former will be called defenders and the latter will be
                called attackers.
                <br>
                In each round of the game, each person only plays once (though not necessarily one card, more
                instruction later). The person who plays the largest value in a particular round will protect/catch
                all the points played in that round for their team.
                <br>
                If the attacking team captures 80 or more points by the end, they win that game and become the
                defending team next game. If the attacking team fails to capture 80 points, the defending team
                levels up and continues as the defending team in the next game. The aim of 80 points is to be the
                first team to play through all levels.
                <br>
                Order of cards from smallest to largest value:
                2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A, Jokers (black, then red)
                <br><br>
                Point-cards and their worths:<br>
                5: 5pt<br>
                10: 10pt<br>
                K: 10pt<br>
                All other cards: no point values<br>
                Total possible points: 200pt<br>
                Note that 5, 10 and K are both playing cards and point cards. That is, if, during the round, the
                previous players have played 2, 6, and 8, the final player can play a 10 to have the largest value
                that round and also protect/catch the 10pts they played.
                <br><br>
                Card-Drawing Process:
                Both teams start at level 2, and level up through the cards until level A. Everyone draws cards from
                the deck in counterclockwise order, one card at a time.
                <br>
                Say the current level is 2: if you draw a 2 and decide to “call” it, the suit of your particular 2
                will be the main suit. Typically, it is beneficial to have as many cards of the main suit as
                possible. If anyone wants to change the main suit, he/she must have A PAIR OF 2s of the same suit.
                In this case, the previous suit will no longer be the main suit. If one decides to make this game no
                main suit, he/she must have A PAIR OF JOKERS (either two red jokers or two black jokers) to call 无主,
                which means that none of the suits is the main suit.
                <br>
                The game is played with two decks and there will be 8 cards left after everyone draws, giving each
                player 25 cards. The 8 leftover cards are the exchange cards.
                <br><br>
                Exchange cards:
                One person from the defending side will be able to pick up the 8 exchange cards. However, they must
                decide to put back down 8 cards from what they have. These 8 cards may consist of any of the 8
                exchange cards that were picked up, or any other cards in their hand, as long as it is 8 total.
                These cards will not be shown to anyone and will not be touched until the end of the game. Whoever
                is in this position has a slight advantage as they essentially get 8 extra cards and are able to get
                rid of 8 unfavorable cards.
                <br>
                If the player decides to “abandon” point value cards, the points are not necessarily safe and can
                still be captured by the attacking side at the very end of each game. More information later.
                <br><br>
                During the Game:
                The game starts with the defender who took the exchange cards. Typically, they will start with
                large-valued cards in their minor suits to give their partner an opportunity to “protect” their
                point cards (ex. I would play an ace of hearts. My partner knows that is almost certain to be the
                largest card that round, so they might play a 10 of hearts to protect those 10pts). After that,
                whoever played the largest card(s) in the previous round will start the upcoming round.
                <br>
                The first person may choose to play anything of his/her choice. After that, the remaining three
                players must play cards of the same suit if they have them.
                <br>
                There are a few ways the first person can start a new round:
                Play one card, where everyone else will follow up with one single card from the original suit if
                they have it.
                Play a pair (two cards of the same value and the same suit), where everyone else must follow with a
                pair of cards from that suit if they have it. If they don’t have a pair, they have to play two
                single cards from the suit. Pairs are always valued over single cards. For example, during the round
                of pairs, a pair of 3’s will be larger than someone playing a K and A.
                Play multiple cards. In this case, it could be a mix of single and/or pair(s) of cards. However, one
                constraint is that any single card in this multiple numbers of cards has to be the largest single
                card out of the cards that haven’t been played yet, and any pair being played has to be guaranteed
                to be the largest pair that has not been played yet. (For example, combinations such as AAK, AKK,
                AKKQQ are always allowed)
                Play a tractor, a combination of two or more consecutive pairs of cards, such as 3344, 8899, JJQQ,
                223344 etc.
                <br>
                All cards played by the first person must be of the same suit. No exceptions.
                <br>
                No matter which of the four scenarios above is happening:
                Everyone must play the same number of cards as the first person of the round; after each round,
                everyone should have the same number of cards left in their hand.
                If any pairs are being played by the first person, all following players must play the maximum
                number of pairs they have to match the number of pairs played by the first person in that suit. If
                any of the players do not have enough pairs, that should be made up of single cards.
                Suits always come first!! If you have ANY cards of the original suit being played in the current
                round, you HAVE TO play them first. Otherwise, your team will be penalized.
                <br>
                Stuffing and Killing (only applies if you do not have any cards of the original suit left):
                Stuffing: Play cards of any other minor suit instead. If you do this, no matter the value of the
                card, it will not be greater than cards of the original suit, thus it can never be the greatest card
                of the round. Say the current round is diamonds, a 3 of diamonds would be greater than an A of clubs
                (assuming clubs is not the main suit for the game).
                Killing: Play a “main card”. Main cards are greater than minor cards. If everyone else plays a minor
                card, but you have none left in that suit, you can play a “main card” and no matter how small your
                main card is, it is always greater than everyone else. However, if the original player plays a pair,
                you must also play a pair of main cards to kill them. If you play two different main cards, it is
                not greater than their pair of minor cards. The same applies to multiple cards and tractors. You
                must have multiple cards or tractors to kill.
                <br>
                At the end of each round, any points caught by the attacking side will be totaled. Note that the
                attacking side can catch their partner’s point cards or the defending team’s point cards; any points
                that were played that round are up for grabs no matter the player.
                <br>
                This repeats in multiple rounds until everyone has played all of their cards.
                <br><br>
                Main cards:
                Main cards include jokers, the “level card” the defenders are currently on (i.e., if the level is 2,
                all 2s NO MATTER THE SUIT are main cards; the “level card” is special and its value is different
                than when it isn’t a “level card”), and all cards of the suit that was called during the
                card-drawing process.
                <br>
                Exception: if a pair of Jokers called for 无主 during the drawing stage, only Jokers and the current
                level cards would count as main cards. All suits are minor cards.
                <br>
                Order: say if a spade of 2 is being called, then the order of the main cards would be spades of 3-A,
                then the 2’s (heart, club, diamond, with equal value), then the spades of 2’s (2 of them in total),
                then the jokers. All other cards are minor cards. The level cards always have the greatest value
                just behind the jokers, no matter the actual number of the card.
                <br>
                In the minor card suits, there are simply no cards where the level cards should be. If we are on the
                level of 2, all 2’s are not taken into account on regular cards. That means if the current round is
                diamonds (assuming diamond is a minor suit), and you have no diamond cards left except 2 of
                diamonds, you may still choose to stuff or kill since the 2 of diamonds in this game is counted as a
                main card, not diamonds.
                <br><br>
                After the game:
                <br>
                Whoever has the largest card for the very last round can protect/catch any points in the exchange
                cards (8 cards that were exchanged at the very beginning of the game).
                <br>
                If defending players are the largest for the last round, they are able to protect any points (5, 10,
                K) that they may have thrown into the exchange cards.
                <br>
                However, if the attacking players are the largest, whatever points are in the exchange cards (and
                exchange cards only) are doubled and added to the total points they caught (5 -> 10pts; 10 -> 20pts;
                K -> 20pts).
                <br>
                If the last round played is more than one card and the catching team is the largest, the points in
                the exchange cards will grow exponentially (2^n, where n is the number of cards in the last round).
                For example, if the last round is played as a pair, the points will quadruple (2^2). Of course, it
                is completely possible that there are no points in the 底牌, which would provide no additional points.
                <br>
                If the defenders win on level 2, they advance to level 3. If the attackers win on level 2, they
                return to whichever level the attackers were on before they were defeated. Each team’s level is
                independent of the other.
                <br><br>
                Skipping levels:
                If 0 points are captured, the defending team skips two levels, advancing three levels. Level 2 skips
                to level 5
                If less than 40 points are captured, the defending team skips one level, advancing two levels. Level
                2 skips to level 4.
                If 40 to 75 points are captured, the defending team advances one level. Level 2 to level 3.
                If 80 to 115 points are captured, the attacking team becomes the defending team on whichever level
                they lost on. Assuming the level they failed to level up on was level 2, the attacking team becomes
                the defending team on level 2.
                If 120 to 155 points are captured, the attacking team becomes the defending team and skips one
                level. Assuming the level they failed to level up on was level 2, the attacking team becomes the
                defending team on level 3.
                If 160 or more points are captured, the attacking team becomes the defending team and skips two
                levels. Assuming the level they failed to level up on was level 2, the attacking team becomes the
                defending team on level 4.
                <br>
                Exception: Levels 2, 5, 10, K, and Ace CANNOT BE SKIPPED.
